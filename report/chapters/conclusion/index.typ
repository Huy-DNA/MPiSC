In this thesis, we have looked into the principles of shared-memory programming e.g. the use of atomic operations, to model and design distributed MPSC queue algorithms. We specifically investigate the existing MPSC queue algorithms in the shared memory literature and adapt them for distributed environments using our model. Following this, we have proposed two new distributed MPSC queue algorithms: dLTQueue and Slotqueue. We have proven various interested theoretical aspects of these algorithms, namely, correctness, fault-tolerance and performance. To reflect on what we have obtained theoretically, we have conducted some benchmarks on how queues behave, using another algorithm known as active-message queue (AMQueue) from @amqueue. Finally, we have discussed some anomalies discovered via the combined application of theory and epiricism.
